    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        I am creating methods for competitive NLP systems. 
        These methods often push things beyond the current state-of-the-art. 
        To achieve this, I am devising general machine learning methods, 
        studying their empirical and theoretical limitations, and incorporating geometric, 
        subsampling, ensemble, and interpretability techniques into structured prediction.

    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
        Since 2019, I have been an assistant professor at the Stevens Institute of Technology. 
        Previously, I was an associate professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a faculty member and Ph.D. advisor at Tsinghua University. 
        As a graduate student supervised by Hermann Ney from RWTH Aachen, I had fruitful visits to IBM in Watson and the NLP group in Microsoft Research (MSR) Redmond. 
        My current research interests are in Machine Learning, with a focus on highly competitive machine translation systems. 
        Lately, I have developed an interest in devising techniques that explore the underlying metric and geometric properties of machine translation systems. 
        I am publishing in mainstream venues in computational linguistics and machine learning (e.g., AAAI, ICML, ACL). 
        I am often leading teams that win first (or one of the first) position in machine translation competitions.
